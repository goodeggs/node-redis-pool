## Methods

### getClient(callback)
Main method. Returns a redis client from the pool. 
The callback is passed **`(error, client, release)`**. 
The **client** object is a normal [redis client][]. 
Release the **client** into a pool by calling the `release()` function (simplest way) 
or call .release(client) method.

### release(client)
This method will release client object back into the pool.

### close(client)
This method will close client object and remove it from pool.

### closeAll()
This method will close all redis clients, what is in pool now. Make sure, what all redis operations are completed, before call this method.
